# Plane-Strain-Analysis-of-C-Clamp-Using-FEA
## Description  This repository presents a **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** of a C-clamp under **plane strain conditions**. The study analyzes stress distribution when pressure is applied to inner surfaces, focusing on **mesh refinement** effects and **numerical singularity**. The material is **structural steel** with linear elastic assumptions.
